# CSS Display: Flexbox and Grid

Today, we'll be taking a look at a modern CSS display property: the flexbox! In my opinion, this is _the_ most useful thing within CSS and see how it is compared to how we had to position things in the past!

## Getting Example Code With Github

From now on, setting up our index.html for content might take a bit of set-up, so instead of starting from scratch each time, we'll get the starter code from a github repository!

### Cloning The Repository

To clone our [teachla-dev-training](https://github.com/uclaacm/teach-la-dev-training) repository, go to the directory of your choice and clone into it with this command!

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/uclaacm/teach-la-dev-training
```

This command pulls all of the source code, writeups, etc that we have written up and puts it onto your local machine.

### Pulling Up And Editing Sample Code

From there, you can open up the directory with your favorite text editor (V.S. Code is my favorite!) and enter our directory which we'll be using this quarter!

```sh
$ cd intro-to-web-dev
```

This week's content is under the 03_flexbox_grid directory, and each week's session will be denoted with a # at the beginning!

```sh
$ cd 03_flexbox_grid
```

To view the website/source code for this session, simply open up index.html in your favorite browser like we outlined in Session 1 and you can edit index.css and index.html as you wish!

## Flexbox/Grid Writeup

This week's content is based off of last year's writeup on Flexbox/Grid located [here!](https://github.com/uclaacm/learning-lab-crash-course-su20/tree/main/04-flexbox-grid)

## Next Steps

Now that we've covered a lot of HTML/CSS, we should be all ready to start working on tickets with the Static Site and contributing to help make [TeachLA's website](https://teachla.uclaacm.com/) awesome! Feel free to contact the static site directory on Slack if you want to take on some tickets and help work on TeachLA's site!
