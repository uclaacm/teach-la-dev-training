# Github Workflows and Intermediate CSS

Now that we've looked at how plain HTML/CSS works, let's take a look at what git/Github is and how we can get started working with the TeachLA website!

## Git Vs GitHub

[Git](http://git-scm.com) is a version control system that lets people collaborate on different projects together. TeachLA and ACM as a whole use it to keep track of our code, so let's take a look at its three main features!

- Backing up your code so that other people can use it in the future, like Google Drive
- Keeping a history of all the changes you made to your code, like Google Docs Edit History.
- Collaborating with people without messing up code through Google Docs.

On the other hand, GitHub is a tool that utilizes git, allowing people to do a lot of extra features on top of github like:

- making sharing/collaborating code with others easiers
- letting you automatically test code with Continuous Integration/Deployment
- Hosting websites with github pages

and a lot more!

We'l go over the rest in a bit more detail but you can check out our TeachLA environment set-up [tutorial](https://teachla.uclaacm.com/docs/dev-setup) to get your TeachLA's website set up on your local machine!

For a detailed guide of what we'll discuss today about CSS, take a look at the previously made [writeup](https://github.com/uclaacm/learning-lab-crash-course-su20/tree/main/02-intermediate-css)!

## Personal Project

Now we should have all the steps needed to continue working on our personal websites! Try making a repository for it, adding more content/CSS to it, and deploying it on GitHub Pages!
