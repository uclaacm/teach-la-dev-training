Here is the [teaching guide meeting notes!](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_Efs2RPFctR7pvc9H0FKwW392MyOPerVHyPsx84sxEU/edit?usp=sharing) and [notes from the meeting](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1DR_JB2zUS0Sb1Cdx_q1r5LZbHlfJQtmBTpBUMbZ6Vdk/edit?usp=sharing) It's somewhat boring stuff so this README would probably be a better read :)
