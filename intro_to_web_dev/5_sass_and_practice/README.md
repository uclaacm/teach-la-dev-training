## Lesson
### SASS
SASS is a preprocessor for CSS that allows you to do more things in CSS! Read about it [here](https://github.com/uclaacm/learning-lab-crash-course-su20/tree/master/10-sass). This will be helpful for working on your static site tickets!

### Practice
We're going to start going over how to make some things that are pretty common or useful components written in HTML, CSS, and JS! Try your hand at making a modal with the starter code. Try not to peek at the finished code!! Also note that the provided finished code is *not* the only answer. There's a lot of different ways to do this, and this is just one of them, provided only for reference.

If you get stuck, message me or hop into my office hours and I can help you.

## Project
Keep working on your site! Maybe you can add some pop ups to feature your personal experience or projects. Don't forget to drop me your repos :)
