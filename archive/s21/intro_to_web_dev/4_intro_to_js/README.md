# Intro to JS

In this session, we'll be learning about the last of the trifecta of components that goes into a static website: Javascript. Unlike HTML, which is a markdown language, or CSS, which is is a style sheet language, Javascript is a programming language. Its syntax is somewhat similar to C/C++, but it has some behaviors that are very different.

## Lesson
Read the [write up](https://github.com/uclaacm/learning-lab-crash-course-su20/tree/master/03-intro-js) written by Matt and Leo. I suggest opening up the Inspector (Ctrl+shift+I or Cmd+option+I) and going to the Console tab to run the code as you go through the document. Get familiar with the syntax!

## Project
Add a `script.js` file to your website. Try manipulating something on your website with an event listener for "click". We'll go over how to build some fancier things using vanilla JS (meaning that we're using plain JS without any frameworks) next week!
