# Intro Track

Hi hi! This is the Intro Track training materials for ACM @ UCLA's Teach LA Dev team for Spring 2021. The series does not require any prior experience and will teach you enough to make a beautiful static website using HTML, CSS, and vanilla Javascript. 

We will be making our own personal web pages to practice and apply what we've learned. While those pre-made websites are nice, they can be template-y and restrictive. From this course, you'll be able to make your own custom websites! Keep in mind that while, we will be walking through some main steps of making the site, you *do not* need to make it exactly the same way. Be creative and have fun! Make it however you like. We'll be teaching you how to publish it on Github Pages as well!
